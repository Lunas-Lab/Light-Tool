# Light Tool
A small web app to use a device as an RGB light panel. That's really all it is. I made it to use for night time photoshoots and to host on a subdomain of my own website. Not very elegant, but it does the job.
## How to use
Tap or click to open the control panel. Use the sliders to adjust the red, green and blue values of the colour to your liking, then press the x at the top right to close the control panel.
